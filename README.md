<!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
## Project Overview

This project focused on predicting customer churn by analyzing customer behavior patterns. We employed decision tree models to identify key churn drivers and features, and utilized logistic regression to generate churn risk scores, enabling the prioritization of at-risk customers for targeted retention strategies.

<!-- Outcomes -->
## Outcomes
Our analysis revealed the following key contributors to customer churn/retention:
1) Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts are strongly associated with higher churn rates.
2) Tenure (Months): Similar to contract type, customer tenure highlights specific periods of increased churn risk,
   particularly around the 9-month and 18-month marks.
4) Technical Support: Customers subscribing to technical support services exhibit greater loyalty to Swan Teleco.
5) Online Security: Customers who opt for online security services also demonstrate higher retention rates.
6) Internet Service: Inclusion of internet service in a customer's package correlates with increased customer retention.
